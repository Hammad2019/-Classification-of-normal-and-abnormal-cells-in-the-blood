Classification of Normal and Abnormal Cells in the Blood

This project involves the classification of normal and abnormal cells in blood using deep learning techniques. The dataset contains labeled images of blood cells, which are used to train a model that can accurately distinguish between normal and abnormal cells. The implementation is in Python, leveraging libraries such as NumPy, pandas, OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Matplotlib.
Dataset

The dataset is located in the ../input/cancer-data/m1/train directory. It contains images of blood cells, each named in a way that indicates its label (normal or not normal).
Usage in Research

This code and dataset were used in our paper "A novel end-to-end deep learning approach for cancer detection based on microscopic medical images," published in Elsevier Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering.
