🧪 Blood Cell Classification: Normal vs Abnormal

This project aims to classify normal and abnormal blood cells using image data and deep learning techniques. It involves reading labeled image data, preprocessing it, and visualizing a sample of the dataset to support future model training and evaluation.
📁 Dataset

    The dataset is located in: ../input/cancer-data/m1/train

    Image files are named with a three-digit prefix label:

        000: Normal cell

        001: Abnormal cell

🛠️ Dependencies

Make sure to install the following Python libraries before running the code:

pip install numpy pandas opencv-python matplotlib seaborn tensorflow

📌 Project Workflow
1. Data Loading and Labeling

    All images are read from the specified directory.

    Each image is resized to 220×220 pixels.

    Labels are extracted from the filename prefix and mapped using a dictionary:

    dict_1 = {'000': 'normal', '001': 'not_normal'}

2. Data Visualization

    Random samples of the blood cell images are displayed in a 3×2 grid.

    Each image is labeled with its respective class (normal or not_normal) for a quick visual inspection of the dataset quality.

📊 Example Output

A sample visualization panel will be generated, showing images with titles indicating whether the cells are normal or not.
📌 Example Code Snippet

img_array = cv2.imread(os.path.join(path, img), cv2.IMREAD_COLOR)
img_array = cv2.resize(img_array, (220, 220))
features.append(img_array)
label = int(img[:3])
labels.append(label)

✅ Future Work

    Training a deep learning model (CNN) for automated classification.

    Model evaluation with validation/testing datasets.

    Performance metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC.
